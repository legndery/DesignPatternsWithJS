**LearnCode.academy**: The flux dispatcher pattern (https://facebook.github.io/flux/) tweaks pubsub just a bit and handles this difficulty very well.  It can create debugging issues of it's own, but is, in general, a better pattern for large apps.  Still, it's a really good pattern for a module to not be directly coupled to all the other modules that rely on it.
